# Web site analytics

Over the last 15 years, tools that track activity on your website have become very common and very sophisticated. For example, here is a country of origin report from [Woopra](https://www.woopra.com/) concerning my research website:

<img src=figures/woopra.png width=500>

These tools can tell you way more than just which pages were accessed most frequently. They can tell you about search terms, browsers, languages, and so on.

**Q**. How the heck does this work? How does Woopra know about my little research website?

## Background

When a browser visits a particular web page, we know that it opens a socket to the server associated with that URL and fetches the HTML (or other data). From there, it renders the HTML visually. It turns out there are a number of HTML tags that actually require the browser to "secretly" fetch data from the same or other servers. Image tags are the most obvious example. In order to display an image, the browser has to fetch that file.

### Which servers does CNN contact?

Using a channel snooper (a proxy), I captured the following histogram of hosts contacted by a **single** visit to the cnn.com home page.

```
  25 	www.cnn.com
   6 	i.cdn.turner.com
   5 	download.cdn.mozilla.net
   4 	z.cdn.turner.com
   2 	widgets.outbrain.com
   2 	hpr.outbrain.com
   2 	131788053.log.optimizely.com
   1 	www.googletagservices.com
   1 	vrt.outbrain.com
   1 	secure-us.imrworldwide.com
   1 	metrics.cnn.com
   1 	log.outbrain.com
   1 	i2.cdn.turner.com
   1 	fast.fonts.net
   1 	facebook.com
   1 	data.cnn.com
   1 	consent.truste.com
   1 	connect.facebook.net
   1 	cdn.optimizely.com
   1 	cdn.livefyre.com
   1 	cdn.krxd.net
   1 	cdn.gigya.com
   1 	cdn.clicktale.net
   1 	b.scorecardresearch.com
   1 	a.visualrevenue.com
```

You can see a lot of weird stuff in there, much of it for ads. For example, Facebook and clicktale. Clicktale's website claims "*Clicktale reveals consumer behavior, needs and intent at every touchpoint of the digital conversation, delivering insights to delight customers and create more value.*"
 
### A toy example

In order to learn the mechanics, consider the following simple webpage with a reference to an image on another site. This HTML file would presumably be on some server xyz.com:

<img src=figures/pageimg.png width=400>

The HTML asks the browser to display a simple image:

<img src=http://www.antlr.org/images/icons/antlr.png>

Your browser makes **two** web requests, one to xyz.com and **another** to www.antlr.org for the image.

Any page on the Internet that references this image would notify my antlr.org server every time a browser visited that page. Now imagine that the image is an invisible 1x1 image and you could see how it could be hidden in lots of websites. Antlr.org could then track references to pages all over the net.   The amount we can track from this image reference depends on how much information we add to the `img` tag URL. Here we are not adding anything but typically JavaScript is used to collect all sorts of information and pass it to the tracking server through URL parameters or cookies (more on this later).

### What is JavaScript?

Modern tracking mechanisms use more than simple `img` tags--they use JavaScript code. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language (that has similar syntax to Java but is oh so very different in semantics) that executes within your browser. Unlike Python, which we can run from the commandline or from within the development environment, JavaScript is typically stored as part of an HTML page and sent from a server back to a browser. The browser displays the HTML page and executes the JavaScript code.

Here's a simple [example](alertjs.html) that pops up a dialog box when you visit the page but doesn't show anything in the page itself.

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script>
    alert('Hello, World!')
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```â€¨
Here's a web page that contains no HTML as static data. Instead a JavaScript program creates the HTML on-the-fly in the browser. I.e., no HTML body tags (other than the JavaScript) is sent from the server.

```html
<html>
<body>
  <script>
  document.body.innerHTML = "<h1>Hi from "+location.pathname+"</h1>"
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you do a save as, you will get the page as you see here, not an actual HTML file with `h1` tags etc...

On the other hand, if you open the developer tools (in Chrome), you can view the HTML generated by the JavaScript and find out all sorts of things about the display page:

<img src=figures/devtoolsjs.png width=500>

Of course, you can also see the source code.

<img src=figures/devtoolsjs2.png width=550>

There is also an amazing JavaScript debugger.

## Tracking mechanism

Okay, let's look at web analytics tracking for real now using two commercial web analytics tools, Woopra and Google analytics.
 
Every page for which I want tracking, I include the following snippet, which you can see by asking for page source on any of my pages:

```html
<!-- Start of Woopra Code -->
<script>
(function(){
    var t,i,e,n=window,o=document,a=arguments,s="script",
    r=["config","track","identify","visit","push","call","trackForm",
    "trackClick"],c=function(){
    ...
})("woopra");
woopra.config({
    domain: 'antlr.org'
});
woopra.track();
</script>
<!-- End of Woopra Code -->
```

This is JavaScript code that contacts Woopra every time this code executes, which is every time the browser loads this page.

I also use Google analytics, which has different looking code but same mechanism:

```html
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
  ga('create', 'xxxxxxxxx', 'auto');
  ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
```

The URL buried in there is the contact address: `www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js`. The JavaScript adds lots of parameters that get sent to the target URL. These identify the page name and lots of information about the browser, operating system, etc. of the user.

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/track")
def hello():
    page = request.args.get('page', default='')
    if len(page)>0:
        print "Visit to page "+page
    return app.send_static_file('images/shim.gif')

app.run()
```
