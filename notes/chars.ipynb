    "# Representing text in a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "As with everything else in the computer, we represent text using numbers. If you look at [7-bit ascii codes](http://www.asciitable.com/), you'll see how Americans encoded the English character set (upper and lower case, numbers, punctuation, and some other characters like newlines and tab). They represent the numbers < 127, which fits in 7 bits.  A string such as \"abc\" was represented by three bytes, one byte per character. It is a very dense encoding, meaning very few bits are wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a very long time, other languages were out of luck. A number of countries used the remaining 128..255 numeric values to encode characters useful to their language such as accented letters like ś and ŝ. They typically used the [Latin-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) character set. The problem is that lots of countries used the number 201, but for different characters.  For example, Russian characters were often mapped to numbers using a [KOI8-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R) mapping that overlapped with the 0..255 used by ASCII, Latin-1. Enter Unicode. See [Unicode vs ascii in python](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html) for more details than I have here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is an agreed-upon standard that maps characters to numeric values (called code points). Conveniently, the first 127 values map exactly to ASCII characters. Here is a [mapping of character to numeric value](http://unicode-table.com/en/). For example, here is how [Bengali characters are encoded](http://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/bengali/):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/bengali.png\" style=\"width:700px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading from this table left to right,  the first character is 980+0, the second is 980+1, etc...  The only trick is that the numbers on the left are in hexadecimal. You will see the notation U+0981. Hexadecimal, base 16, is used because all possible values within 16 bits fit in 4 hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent Unicode we have to use 16-bit (2 byte) not 8-bit (1 byte) characters. Rats. Oh well, we can buy more memory. According to the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Under the hood, Python represents Unicode strings as either 16- or 32-bit integers, depending on how the Python interpreter was compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, regular Python string `\"abc\"` takes three bytes but if we represented as a Unicode string, it takes 3 x 2 bytes = 6 bytes.  We can verify this char size with the `getsizeof` function:"

    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is a simple encoding of Unicode strings that is optimized for the ASCII characters. In each byte of the encoding, the high bit determines if more bytes follow. A high bit of zero means that the byte has enough information to fully represent a character; ASCII characters require only a single byte.
