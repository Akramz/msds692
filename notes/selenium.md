# Selenium 

We have seen how to use Python programs to scrape data from websites, but there are three scenarios that make it more challenging

1. Accessing data behind login screens
2.  Having to click through a bunch of stuff to dig into the middle of a website somewhere without a clear URL to jump to
3. Accessing data that is the result of executing JavaScript

[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is a tool that lets us automate actions within a browser as if we were clicking or typing as a human. This lets us login and do anything else a human can do when using the browser. Perhaps most importantly, it allows us to scrape data from webpages that generate HTML using JavaScript executing within the browser; i.e., there are some webpages that are pure JavaScript and no HTML.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U selenium
pip install chromedriver
```

(*The last install failed for some students but they were still able to do the exercises.*)

Next, download [Chrome driver binary](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) using your browser The pip stuff just makes the python packages but the real meat is in the binary download. Now, move the executable binaries to a standard place:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/chromedriver /usr/local/bin
mv ~/Downloads/geckodriver /usr/local/bin
```

## Launching a Chrome Browser

Here is the boilerplate code that launches a chrome browser to the Google search page, waits for a keypress, and then closes the browser.

```python
import time
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')  # Optional argument, if not specified will search path.
driver.get('http://www.google.com')

# here is where some useful work would typically happen

raw_input("Press Enter to quit")
driver.quit() # close browser
```

Notice that this is creating an entirely new instance of the browser (You'll see more a new chrome icon appear).

**Exercise**: Make sure you can get that code working.

## Puppeteering with Chrome Browser

Let's start by asking chrome to perform a search for `USF Analytics`. The
[Selenium python API doc](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html#locating-elements) shows us that we can find elements by name. Conveniently the name of the search entry box is `q`, determined by using `inspect` functionality in the chrome browser itself:

<img src=figures/google-searchbox.png width=500>

**Exercise**: Using the boilerplate code from the previous section, add the following functionality and watch the browser perform a search for you.

```python
search_box = driver.find_element_by_name('q')
search_box.send_keys('USF Analytics')
search_box.submit()
```

## Support code for logging in

We don't ever want to store a username and password in our source code. Also, if we hardcoded info like that, we could not use software for different users. Instead, I built a little dialog box in `login.py` that asks for a username and password from the user. The `login()` returns when the user clicks on the `Login` button:

```python
from Tkinter import *

def login():
    master = Tk()
    Label(master, text="Username").grid(row=0)
    Label(master, text="Password").grid(row=1)

    user = Entry(master)
    password = Entry(master, show="*")

    user.grid(row=0, column=1)
    password.grid(row=1, column=1)

    Button(master, text='Login', command=master.quit).grid(row=3, column=0, sticky=W, pady=4)
    master.bind('<Return>', lambda x: master.quit())

    mainloop()

    return user.get(), password.get()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print login()
```

If you get an error that Tkinter is not a valid package, verify you are using the right python. If you are, then you might try:

```bash
brew uninstall python
brew install python --with-brewed-tk
```

**Exercise**: Run that program and verify that it prints out a sample (meaningless) username and password.
 
## Log in to twitter, pull a following list

 In order to login to twitter, we can go directly to `https://twitter.com/login`, where we see `form` fields:

```html
<input class="js-username-field email-input js-initial-focus"
 type="text"
 name="session[username_or_email]"
 autocomplete="on" value="" placeholder="Phone, email or username">
```

and

```html
<input class="js-password-field"
 type="password" name="session[password]"
 placeholder="Password">
```

That is where the user should enter their username and password. We need to launch a chrome browser at that URL and then inject characters into those two fields.  I tried selecting the input fields by `name` but it didn't work so I had to use the CSS `class` selector.

**Exercise**:  Write a script to login to twitter. You need these statements to select the input fields:

```python
userfield = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('.js-username-field.email-input.js-initial-focus')
passwordfield = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('.js-password-field')
```

**Exercise**: Next, alter the script to view the list of users followed by our Data Institute. You can get this information starting here `https://twitter.com/DataInstituteSF`. From that page, have the browser click on the `Following` link. I see this using the Chrome "inspect" feature:

```html
<a ... data-nav="following" href="/DataInstituteSF/following" ...>
  ...
</a>
```

The `data-nav=following` appears to be unique.  Find that with seleniums functions and then `click()` it.

**Exercise**:  Alter the script so that it (i) pages down twice to see more users followed by the Data Institute using: `driver.execute_script("window.scrollTo(0, 10000);")` and (ii) collects all of the `following` `a` tags into a list of tuples with (*link*,*link text*). I get:

```
[(u'https://twitter.com/DataInstituteSF', u''), 
(u'https://twitter.com/Vungle', u'Vungle'),
(u'https://twitter.com/fueledbytri', u'Kimberly Shenk'),
(u'https://twitter.com/decodyng', u'Cody Wild'),
(u'https://twitter.com/samswey', u'Samuel Sinyangwe'),
(u'https://twitter.com/CRASEusf', u'CRASE'),
(u'https://twitter.com/oaklandmuseumca', u'Oakland Museum of CA'),
(u'https://twitter.com/Tate', u'Tate'), 
(u'https://twitter.com/deyoungmuseum', u'de Young Museum'),
(u'https://twitter.com/SFMOMA', u'SFMOMA'),
(u'https://twitter.com/interian', u'Yannet Interian'),
(u'https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward', u'Jeremy Howard'),
(u'https://twitter.com/the_antlr_guy', u'The ANTLR Guy'),

(u'https://twitter.com/sjengle', u'Sophie Engle'),
(u'https://twitter.com/bayesimpact', u'Bayes Impact'),
(u'https://twitter.com/kdnuggets', u'Gregory Piatetsky')]
```

The links are of the form:
 
```html
<a class="ProfileNameTruncated-link u-textInheritColor js-nav js-action-profile-name"
 href="/Vungle"
 data-aria-label-part="">
 Vungle
</a>
...
<a class="ProfileNameTruncated-link u-textInheritColor js-nav js-action-profile-name"
 href="/decodyng"
 data-aria-label-part="">
 Cody Wild
</a>
```    

and you can select them by using:
 
```python
links = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector('a.ProfileNameTruncated-link')
```

## Demo of JavaScript creating HTML

Selenium not only allows us to login and collect data, it lets us do that for pages that are generated by JavaScript. So far we've only pulled data from pages with HTML coming back from the server. In the next section, we'll pull data from Slack but it sends no HTML with data to the browser. It sends a JavaScript program (a "single-page app") that pulls data from the server to the browser behind the scenes and then generates HTML on the fly.

**Exercise**: To demo that capability, save this html+javascript into a file and load in your browser. You'll "USF MSAN" in the browser.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script LANGUAGE="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
    window.onload=function() { // run after page loads
        var p = document.getElementById("stuff");
        var add_news = document.createTextNode("USF MSAN");
        p.appendChild(add_news);
    }
    </script>
</head>
<body>

<p id="stuff">
</body>
</html>
```

## Pull messages from slack w/o API

The slack website is

`https://msan-usf.slack.com`

and has two text fields you can "inspect" and identify. The message list URL for `general` is:

`https://msan-usf.slack.com/messages/general/`

The "inspect element" shows messages themselves to look like:

```html
<span class="message_body">Whoooooooooops.</span>
```

Such `span`s are nested within an outer wrapper that also helps us identify the user:

```html
<ts-message id="msg_1449864508_000895" data-member-id="..." ...>
   ...
   <div class="message_content ">
   <a href="/team/parrt" target="/team/parrt" class="message_sender member member_preview_link color_U0A2V9N94 color_4bbe2e " data-member-id="U0A2V9N94">hanjoes</a>
   ...
   </div>
</ts-message>
```

That has a weird non-HTML tag but we can still search for it by tag name with selenium.

The links returned by selenium for the user look like `https://msan-usf.slack.com/team/parrt`.

**Exercise**: To get started, write a script to login to slack and jump to a specific channel like `general`. My outline looks like:

```python
from login import login
import time
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')

def login_and_show_channel(channel):
    user,password = login()
    driver.get(...)
    userfield = driver.find_element_by_id(...)
    userfield.send_keys(user)
    passwordfield = driver.find_element_by_id(...)
    passwordfield.send_keys(password)
    passwordfield.submit()

    driver.get(...)

login_and_show_channel("general")

raw_input("Press Enter to quit")
driver.quit() # close browser
```

**Exercise**: Write a program to login to slack's website (not the API) using selenium and get messages from a channel with messages, such as our MSAN `general` channel.  Create a function `parse_slack` that returns list of tuples with (user,message) and then have your main code print the stuff out:

```python
msgs = parse_slack()
for user,msg in msgs:
    print "%s: %s" % (user, msg)
```

There is a tricky thing to worry about: We have to wait 5 seconds or so for the brower to load our page and for the javascript to load data from slack's servers and populate the page.

Find the messages using tag name `ts-message`. Within each of those, get the message text by finding class name `message_body`. 

Get the user by finding the `message_icon` class under the `ts-message` node. Under that, find the `a` tag and grab the `href` attribute. Use a regex to pull out the user name:

```python
user = re.search(r'/team/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', href).group(1)
```

That groups user names after the `/team/` in `href` and then asks for the first (and only) group value.  Add the user and message as a tuple to a list and return from `parse_slack` when done.
