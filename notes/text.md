# Representing text in a computer

As with everything else in the computer, we represent text using numbers. If you look at [7-bit ascii codes](http://www.asciitable.com/), you'll see how Americans encoded the English character set (upper and lower case, numbers, punctuation, and some other characters like newlines and tab). They represent the numbers < 127, which fits in 7 bits. For a very long time, other languages were out of luck. A number of countries used the remaining 128..255 numeric values to encode characters useful to their language such as accented letters like ś and ŝ.
