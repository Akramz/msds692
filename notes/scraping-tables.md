## Extracting a table of data

Let's see if we can pull academic performance data from [2012-13 Accountability Progress Reporting (APR)](http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/Acnt2013/2013GrthStAPI.aspx).

**Exercise**: Create a list of lists representation for the `2013 Growth API` table and another for the `Number of Students Included in the 2013 Growth API` table. Or try list of dictionary representation.  Consider hardcoding the headers into your script or you can pull the headers too. *This one is challenging*!
