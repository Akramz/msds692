    "\n",
    "Let's get some data. Download [Sample Superstore Sales .xls file](https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236) or [my local copy](../data/SampleSuperstoreSales.xls) and open it in Excel. Select `File>Save As...` menu option and then \"Comma separated values (.csv)\" from the `Format:` drop-down menu. Set the filename to `SampleSuperstoreSales.csv` or similiar. That will warn you that the data cannot be saved as CSV without losing some information. Don't worry about that because it's only formatting and not data information that you will lose. Say \"Save Active Sheet\". Then it will helpfully give you a second warning. Tell it to continue.\n",

It turns out it's weirder than you think and is actually a two-byte character `U+00AE` encoding the registered trademark symbol &#x00AE;.  From experience with these data formats, it means that Excel is saving things using a \"Latin-1\" text encoding (0..255 char values). That encoding is essentially ASCII but anything above code 127 is Euro-specific. So, we need to fix that by stripping those out. \n",
