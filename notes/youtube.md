# YouTube

YouTube, like Zillow, will allow us to use its data spigot without authentication, but we must create a secret ID or key as we did before:

> If your client application does not use OAuth 2.0, then it must include an API key when it calls an API that's enabled within a Google Cloud Platform project. The application passes this key into all API requests as a key=API_key parameter. API keys do not grant access to any account information, and are not used for authorization.

Follow these steps to get set up:
 
1. [Get a google account](https://www.google.com/accounts) if you don't already have one.
2. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a project. I call mine msan692-test or something like that.
3. Enable the "YouTube Data API v3" API from your console.

Familiarize yourself with the [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) and install some Python code that will make our lives easier:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```

## First contact

The Python library we are using hides all of the direct URL access so that this code will look different than what we did for Zillow. Using our developer key, we `build()` an object that acts like a proxy, letting us communicate with YouTube:

```python
# code from https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/code_samples/python#search_by_keyword
import sys
import urllib
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

DEVELOPER_KEY = sys.argv[1]
QUERY = sys.argv[2] # e.g., "cats and dogs"
QUERY = urllib.quote(QUERY)
YOUTUBE_API_SERVICE_NAME = "youtube"
YOUTUBE_API_VERSION = "v3"

youtube = build(YOUTUBE_API_SERVICE_NAME, YOUTUBE_API_VERSION, developerKey=DEVELOPER_KEY)
```

Given that object, we can make a search, retrieving a list of elements:

```python
search_response = youtube.search().list(
    q=QUERY,            # search terms
    part="id,snippet",  # what we want back
    maxResults=20,      # how many results we want back
    type="video"        # only tell me about videos
).execute()
```

**Exercise**: The `search_response` variable is a `dict` with an `items` key containing the search results. Use the debugger or look at [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos#properties) to figure out what the elements of the individual search responses are. As usual, it appears there is a small discrepancy between the documentation and what I see in the actual dictionary. Figure out how to print the title and a link to the videos returned from the search. E.g., Running from the command-line, we should get:

```bash
$ search.py MYSECRETKEY cats
