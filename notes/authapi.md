## OAuth

When it comes to a data collection program (the *client*), most REST APIs will require the program to authenticate using OAuth.  A *resource owner*, such as a Facebook or twitter user, has data stored on a *resource server*. The idea is that the Facebook user should not have to give their login credentials to a client program so that the client can login. Instead, the client gets an access token from an *authorization server* (usually just another server at target company) with approval (e.g., logging in with a dialogue box) from the resource owner. Given the access token, the client can access resources from the resource server.

This sequence is a tricky thing to get right but the basic idea is as follows.

1. The client program developer goes to a target company's developer website, such as twitter, and asks for an application ID or some other ID that will allow them access to the API. You might also get a so-called secret key from the company.
1. The client program contacts a URL on the  authorization server at the target company to request access using the application ID and usually a secret key.
1. The  authorization server at that URL accepts the credentials and sends an access token back to the  client program via a URL typically specified in the application settings on the target company's developer dashboard or as a `redirect_uri` parameter on the authentication request. As you can see in my examples, authentication requires that your  client pretend to be a web server for one HTTP request, to collect to the access token generated by the target company server.
1. The client program can then make REST API calls using the access token, usually for a limited period of time.

 From the [OAuth 2 document](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749):
