# Recommending Articles

The goal of this project is to learn how to make a simple article recommendation engine using a semi-recent advance in natural language processing called [word2vec](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) (or just *word vectors*). In particular, we're going to use a "database" from [Stanford's GloVe project](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) trained on a dump of Wikipedia. The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing.

Around the recommendation engine, you are going to build a web server that displays a list of [BBC](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) articles for URL `http://localhost` (testing) or whatever the IP address is of your Amazon server (deployment):

<img src=figures/articles.png width=200>

Clicking on one of those articles takes you to an article page that shows the text of the article as well as a list of five recommended articles:

<img src=figures/article1.png width=450>

<img src=figures/article2.png width=450>

You will do your work in `recommender-`*userid*.

## Discussion

### Article word-vector centroids

Those of you who were not in the [MSAN501 computational boot camp](https://github.com/parrt/msan501) should read the project description [Word similarity and relationships](https://github.com/parrt/msan501/blob/master/projects/wordsim.md). The document explains word vectors enough to complete this project.

In a nutshell, each word has a vector of, say, 300 floating-point numbers that somehow capture the meaning of the word, at least as it relates to other words within a corpus. These vectors are derived from a neural network that learns to map a word to an output vector such that neighboring words in some large corpus are close in 300-space. ("The main intuition underlying the model is the simple observation that ratios of word-word co-occurrence probabilities have the potential for encoding some form of meaning." see [GloVe project](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).)

Two words are related if their word vectors are close in 300 space. Similarly, if we compute the centroid of a document's cloud of word vectors, related articles should have centroids close in 300 space. Words that appear frequently in a document push the centroid in the direction of that word's vector. The centroid is just the sum of the vectors divided by the number of words in the article. Given an article, we can compute the distance from its centroid to every other article's centroid. The article centroids closest to the article of interest's centroid are the most similar articles. Surprisingly, this simple technique works well as you can see from the examples above.

Given a word vector filename, such as `glove.6B.300d.txt`, and the root directory of the BBC article corpus, we will use the following functions from `doc2vec.py` in the main `server.py` file to load them into memory:

```python
# get commandline arguments
glove_filename = sys.argv[1]
articles_dirname = sys.argv[2]

gloves = load_glove(glove_filename)
articles = load_articles(articles_dirname, gloves)
```

The `gloves` variable is the dictionary mapping a word to its 300-vector vector. The `articles` is a list of records, one for each article. An article record is just a list containing the fully-qualified file name, the article title, the text without the title, and the word vector computed from the text without the title.

Then to get the list of most relevant five articles, we'll do this:

```python
seealso = recommended(doc, articles, 5)
```

The description of those functions is in `doc2vec.py` from the starter kit, but it's worth summarizing them here:

```python
def load_articles(articles_dirname, gloves):
    """
    Load all .txt files under articles_dirname and return a table (list of lists)
    where each record is a list of:

      [filename, title, article-text-minus-title, wordvec-for-article-text]

    This record will be updated by add_doc2vecs() to include word vectors at position 3
    of the record.  We use gloves parameter to compute the word vector.
    """
    ...
```
 
```python
def recommended(article, articles, n):
    """
    Return a list of the n articles (records with filename, title, etc...)
    closest to article's word vector centroid.
    """
    ...
```

### Web server

Besides those core functions, you need to build a web server as well using flask. To learn how to launch a flask web server at Amazon, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQncEJL6NHs&t=156s) I made. The server should respond to two different URLs: the list of articles is at `/` and each article is at something like `/article/business/353.txt`. The BBC corpus in directory `bbc` is organized with topic subdirectories and then a list of articles as text files:

<img src="figures/bbc.png" width=300>

So, if you are testing and from your laptop, you would go to the following URL in your browser to get the list of articles:

`http://localhost/`

And to get to a specific article you would go to:

`http://localhost/article/business/030.txt`

The `localhost` will be replaced with an IP address or some machine name given to you by Amazon when you deploy your server.

For display purposes, I have given you some CSS to make the pages look good and to have the recommendation box on the right side gutter.   Please figure out how to use font size 70% and font family Verdana, sans-serif for the text just like you see in the examples at the start of this document.

The `server.py` file contains flask "routes" for the necessary URLs. You just have to fill in those functions:

```Python
@app.route("/")
def articles():
    """Show a list of article titles"""
```

```Python
@app.route("/article/<topic>/<filename>")
def article(topic,filename):
    """
    Show an article with relative path filename.
    Assumes the BBC structure of topic/filename.txt
    so our URLs follow that.
    """
```    

Also note that we are using the template engine [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/) that is built-in with flask. When you call `render_template()` from within a flask route method, it looks in the `templates` subdirectory for the file indicated in that function call. You need to pass in appropriate arguments to the two different page templates so the pages fill with data.

## Getting started

Download the [starterkit](https://github.com/parrt/msan692/tree/master/hw/code/recommender), which has the following files and structure:

```
├── doc2vec.py
├── server.py
└── templates
    ├── article.html
    └── articles.html
```

There are predefined functions with comments indicating the required functionality.

## Deliverables

### Github

In your github repository, you should submit the following:

* IP.txt; this is a single line text file terminated by a newline character that indicates the machine name or IP address of your server at Amazon
* doc2vec.py; implement `words()`, `doc2vec()`, `distances()`, `recommended()`
* server.py; implement `articles()`, `article()` flask routes
* templates/articles.html; use template language to generate the right HTML for the main list of articles page
* templates/article.html; use template language to generate the right HTML for an article page

**Please do not add data files such as the word vectors or the BBC corpus to your repository!**

### AWS

As part of your submission, you must launch a Linux instance at Amazon and install your software + necessary data. Then launch your server and keep it running for the duration of our grading period. We will notify you when it's okay to terminate that instance. Choose a server that is only one or two cents per hour.

Here is how I launch my server on AWS or locally:
 
```bash
$ sudo python server.py ~/data/glove/glove.6B.300d.txt ~/github/msan692/data/bbc
```

Note that I have given fully qualified pathnames to the word vectors and the root of the BBC article corpus. The `sudo` is required so that the server runs as the superuser, which is the only user that is able to open a process listening at port 80 (the HTTP web protocol port).

## Evaluation

To evaluate your projects, the grader and I will run the [test_server.py](https://github.com/parrt/msan692/blob/master/hw/code/recommender/test_server.py) script, from your repo root directory, that automatically pulls your article list page and a selection of article pages to check that your recommendations match our solution.

**Without the IP.txt file at the root of your repository, we cannot test your server and you get a zero!** Our script reads your IP.txt file with:
 ```python
with open("IP.txt") as f:
    host = f.read().strip()
```

The starterkit has `localhost` in it so you can test locally before deploying to your server.

It also reads some pickled "truth" data structures that encode the articles from my solution's web server. That data was generated with [pickle_truth.py](https://github.com/parrt/msan692/blob/master/hw/code/recommender/pickle_truth.py).

Here is a sample test run:

```bash
$ cd ~/grading/MSAN692/recommender-parrt
$ python -m pytest -v test_server.py
============================================ test session starts =============================================
platform darwin -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-2.9.2, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.3.1 -- /Users/parrt/anaconda2/bin/python

collected 2 items 

test_server.py::test_links PASSED
test_server.py::test_sample_articles PASSED

========================================== 2 passed in 0.57 seconds ==========================================
```


Getting the article list right is worth 20% and getting the recommended articles right is worth 80%. As you have the complete test, you should be able to get it working and we will grade in binary fashion (works or it doesn't).
